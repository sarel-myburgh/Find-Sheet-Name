# Purpose

This AppScript searches an entire Google Worksheet for a specific value, and then returns the name of the sheet it was found in.

# Example
You have a Worksheet called Departments. In Departments you have the following sheets: Management, IT, Finance, Marketing.

You can add another sheet called Search. Add the name of the person you are looking for in A1, and in B1 the formula =findSheetName(A1), this will then find the name of the sheet where that name is. 
So if Bob Marley is present in the Management sheet, B1 will have the value "Management".
